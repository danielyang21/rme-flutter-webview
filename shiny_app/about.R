    "<strong>The RM Explorer uses data from the digital certificates of reference materials and open-source compound identifiers (InChI / InChIKeys) to calculate information and present it in a user-friendly way. 
    It also creates an integrated data structure by fetching information from external sources such as PubChem and comparing the information presented in these external sources to its calculated values.
    </strong> <br><br><strong>The RM Explorer was structured to present data in a way that complies with FAIR principles (https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/): </strong><br><br>",
    "<br><h3>Findable</h3><br>",
    "<strong>F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier </strong><br>",
    "Each RM in the explorer is identified by a DOI record in the digital repository. Data can be downloaded with rich metadata.<br><br>",
    "<strong>F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below) </strong><br>",
    "All data has associated metadata that ensures its traceability and analytically relevant information.<br><br>",
    "<strong>F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe</strong><br>",
    "Metadata includes the chemical identifiers and DOI when downloaded.<br><br>",
    "<strong>F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource</strong><br>",
    "All data is indexed in the DOI record.<br><br>",
    "<br><h3>Accessible</h3><br>",
    "<strong>A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol </strong><br>",
    "Data and metadata present in the RM Explorer are retrievable by their identifiers through the app and the NRC digital repository and are downloadable in common (.csv) file formats. <br><br>",
    "<strong>A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable </strong><br>",
    "The website is open and downloaded data and metadata use non-proprietary (.csv) format. <br><br>",
    "<strong>A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available </strong><br>",
    "Metadata are stored in the repository using DOI which are widely known persistent identifiers. <br><br>",
    "<br><h3>Interoperable</h3><br>",
    "<strong>I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation. </strong><br>",
    "Data use formats that are widely accepted (DOIs), open-source (InChI) and non-proprietary (.csv). <br><br>",
    "<strong>I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles </strong><br>",
    "Vocabularies used are fully fair compliant (DOIs and InChIs). <br><br>",
    "<strong>I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data </strong><br>",

    "<br><h3>Reusable</h3><br>",
    "<strong>R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes </strong><br>",
    "The RM Explorer integrates different data sources (APIs) in user-friendly interface to machine-readable digital CRM certificates. Therefore the attributes of the (meta)data are shared with the data sources. <br><br>",
